Refactor the "Contact Book" application code by adding state control using the [Redux Toolkit] library (https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). Let the Redux state look like this.

{
  contacts: [],
  filter: ""
}

Create a repository with configureStore()
Use createSlice()
Create actions to save and delete a contact, and update the filter
Link React-components to Redux-logic with bibliothec hooks react-redux
Use the Redux Persist library to save an array of contacts to local storage
